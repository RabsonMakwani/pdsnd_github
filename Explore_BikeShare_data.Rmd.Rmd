#Question 1:Who has higher trip duration on average between males and females in chicago and new_york_city ?


#Differentiating trip duration by Gender in chicago
library(ggplot2)

#The code generates a summary on trip duration by gender in chicago
by(chicago$`Trip Duration`, chicago$Gender, summary)

#males have a median of 542.0 and females have a median of  648.0
#Therefore on average females have higher trip duration in chicago than the males
